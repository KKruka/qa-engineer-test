# QA Engineer Test Solution

This is my solution for the Estoty QA Engineer test assignment which is unfortunately only partially fulfilled.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, make sure you have:

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and the correct **Unity Editor** version (check `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` in this repo).
- [AltTester Desktop Community Edition](https://alttester.com/) (for connecting Unity with the test driver).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

## Setup
1. Run the game from the Estoty repository
2. Inject AltTester into the game
3. Run the tests in Unity Hub

## Test Cases
- TestButtonIsInteractable - Checks if button is clickable
- TestCounterIncreasesOnButtonPress - Checks counter increases on click
- TestTenClicksMakesCounterTen - Checks 10 clicks = counter of 10
